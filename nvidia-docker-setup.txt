This guide explains how to setup an arbitrary docker container to work like a previously set up nvidia-docker container.

1) We assume that the desired nvidia driver is installed on the host. We create the following directory structure by copying the binaries/libraries from the installation folders:

nvidia/
	bin/
		nvidia-smi
	lib64/
		libcuda.so (as a symbolic link to the actual installed version, which should be copied as well)
		libnvidia-ml.so (as a symbolic link to the actual installed version, which should be copied as well)
		(you might need to copy the right version libcudnn.so too)
